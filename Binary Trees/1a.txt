Root, children, leaf, subtree, ancestors.

Full binary tree
    Every node has 0 or 2 children.
    No node with one child

Complete binary tree
    All levels completely filled except last
    Last level has all nodes to as left as possible

Perfect binary tree
    All nodes have two children
    All leaf nodes at same level

Balanced binary tree
    Height of tree is order logn
    the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.

Degenerate trees
    Every parent has only one child node.
    skewed trees i.e more like a linked list.
