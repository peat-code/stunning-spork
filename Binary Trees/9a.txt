Iterative approach to traversals.

DFS:


Iterative preoder:
    Add root to stack
    while stack
        pop element and print
        push its right child
        push its left child

Iterative InOrder:
    Add root to stack
    while stack
        pop element and print
        push its right child
        push its left child

Iterative PostOrder:
    Add root to stack
    while stack
        pop element and print
        push its right child
        push its left child
